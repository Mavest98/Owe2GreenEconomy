            <p class="text-justify text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
                Knowing more about the big issues facing the Climate, Nature, Food, and Fashion gives you more power to make the right decisions for you and the future of our generation and the planet. Humanity, animals, plants, and other living beings need a specific climate in order to live. Since the Industrial Revolution, our planet has been heating up at a much quicker rate than ever before—with damaging consequences. We have been burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas to provide electricity, heating, and transportation, but this releases carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases into the atmosphere. They hang in the air like an invisible blanket, trapping the heat from the Sun and stopping it from returning to space, warming up the Earth’s surface temperature. As a result, we are seeing extreme weather patterns, from floods to droughts across the globe. It is also causing glaciers and ice caps to melt, causing sea levels to rise. While we cannot reverse the damage, we can make changes to slow things down, reduce our impact here on Earth, and create a more sustainable future.
